## Introduction
This project is an Arbitrary Function Generator implemented on an FPGA board using VHDL. It allows users to generate 4 different waveforms - sine, ramp, triangular and square. It has an option to vary the frequency, voltage offset and amplitude of the wave.

## Features
- **Waveform Generation:** Generate any of the 4 waveforms - sine, square, triangle & ramp.
- **Customization:** Adjust frequency and amplitude for precise waveform control.
- **User Interface:** Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the FPGA board.
- **Versatile Applications:** Suitable for various applications, including signal processing, educational purposes, and more.
